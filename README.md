# Modifying-Ruby-s-Adventure

Original challenge:  I did not have to make any changes.

Visual change: I made a few visual changes to my final version of this game. The first being a new interactive NPC. It is a blacked out anonymous character on the first level near Jambi. The second being a new fox NPC as well as some slime NPCs in the water throughout all of the levels. Lastly, I added a boss level which is a visually entirely new. It is a new map with a new boss NPC. 

Audio change: I added a few new audio changes. One being the boss NPC. When it is hit, it makes a metal sound and when defeated an explosion sound. Second, I added a sound for when the player picks up cogs. These effects only happen when the player (Ruby) interacts and does a specific thing to trigger the sound event. 

Gameplay changes: I added what I believe to be two significant and original changes to the gameplay. The first being the anonymous NPC, that when talked to twice, sends you to a new level. This NPC talks about needing your help because of a HUGE disaster that happened. The second being that when on that level, the player must defeat the boss and collect the reward to return to the first level of the game and beat the following two levels. The player also gets a new powerup when picking up this reward. The players cogs now throw in a spread of three cogs for each one cog of ammo. This powerup lasts the rest on both level one and two.
